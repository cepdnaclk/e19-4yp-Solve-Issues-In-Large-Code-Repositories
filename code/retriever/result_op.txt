The correct place to add validation logic for related_name in symmetrical relationships is in the __init__ or check method of ManyToManyField, both of which reside here. This aligns with Django's established validation patterns and ensures errors are raised early during model definition."},
  {'file': 'django/django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py',
   'confidence': 20,
   'reason': 'While this file handles reverse relations via ManyToManyRel, symmetrical relationships do not create reverse relations, so validation here would be ineffective. The logic to prevent invalid related_name usage with symmetrical=True should be enforced at the source field level, not in the reverse relation infrastructure.'},

   'confidence': 5,
   'reason': 'This file only defines exception classes and does not contain validation logic. The existing FieldError exception is sufficient for this case, and the error should be raised from the field implementation, not from this file.'}],

   'reason': "This file contains the PasswordResetTokenGenerator and its _make_hash_value() method, which is directly responsible for generating password reset tokens. The vulnerability arises because the user's email is not included in the hash, allowing tokens to remain valid after an email change. The fix requires modifying this method to include the email, making this file the epicenter of the bug and the only necessary location for the immediate security fix."},

   'reason': 'This file defines AbstractBaseUser, which is referenced in the issue only to note that email is not a required field. While there is a theoretical argument for factoring token logic into the user model, this is not required for the immediate fix. Its relevance is minimal and speculative, as no changes here are needed to resolve the vulnerability.'},
  {'file': 'django/django/contrib/auth/models.py',
   'confidence': 5,
   'reason': 'This file is not directly related to the password reset token logic. The mention of user models in the issue is only in the context of possible future refactoring, not the current security fix. Thus, its relevance is extremely low.'}],

 37: [{'file': 'django/django/forms/models.py',
   'confidence': 100,
   'reason': "This file contains the implementation of ModelChoiceField, which is directly responsible for the bug. The issue is that ModelChoiceField's default_error_messages lacks the %(value)s placeholder, and its validation logic does not pass the invalid value to ValidationError. This is in contrast to ModelMultipleChoiceField in the same file, which handles this correctly. The fix requires changes to ModelChoiceField's error message and validation method, both of which are implemented in this file."},
  {'file': 'django/django/forms/fields.py',
   'confidence': 30,
   'reason': 'This file contains the base ChoiceField, which uses %(value)s correctly in its error messages. However, ModelChoiceField overrides both the error messages and validation logic in models.py, so the root cause is not here. This file is only tangentially relevant as a reference for correct behavior.'},
  {'file': 'django/django/core/exceptions.py',
   'confidence': 5,
   'reason': 'This file defines ValidationError, which is used to raise validation errors. The bug is not in the exception itself, but in how it is used by ModelChoiceField. Other fields use ValidationError correctly, so there is no need to modify this file.'}],

   'confidence': 100,
   'reason': "The bug is caused by the use of exec(options['command']) in the handle() method of this file, without providing a globals dictionary. This leads to Python's scoping rules breaking, as imports in the executed code are not available in nested function scopes. The stack trace and issue description both directly implicate this file and this specific line. The fix (adding a globals dict to exec) must be applied here, making this file unquestionably the root cause."},

   'reason': 'Although this file provides the base command infrastructure, it does not contain the exec call or any logic related to executing user code in the shell command.

The logic for 'show_save_as_new' in the submit_row context is missing a 'has_add_permission' check, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. Modifying this file to include the permission check would resolve the issue. The path matches the canonical structure of the Django repository, and the reasoning is technically sound."},
  {'file': 'django/django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py',
   'confidence': 95,
   'reason': "This file is functionally identical to the primary candidate but includes a duplicated 'django/django' path prefix, which may reflect a repository structure inconsistency. It contains the same submit_row context logic where the permission check is missing.

  {'file': 'django/django/contrib/auth/models.py',

   'confidence': 95,
   'reason': 'This file is responsible for the implementation of the `inspectdb` management command, which is directly implicated in the issue. The bug is that inspectdb does not generate unique `related_name` values for ForeignKeys pointing to the same model, leading to clashes. The logic for generating model code from the database schema resides here, so the fix must be applied in this file by enhancing the code generation to detect and resolve related_name collisions. The high confidence reflects the direct connection, with a small deduction for possible dependencies on lower-level utilities.'},

The bug involves enum members (from TextChoices/IntegerChoices) not being properly converted to their primitive values during assignment or retrieval. Methods like to_python or get_prep_value in this file are likely failing to unwrap enum values, leading to the observed issue. The high confidence is due to this file's direct control over value handling in model fields."},

   'confidence': 35,
   'reason': "This file defines the TextChoices and IntegerChoices enums. While it is involved in the enum mechanism, the bug is not in enum definition but in how model fields consume these enums.

   'reason': 'This file implements the RenameModel migration operation. The root cause is that RenameModel does not check for the presence of a custom db_table before proceeding with database operations. As a result, unnecessary and potentially destructive schema changes are triggered when db_table is set, even though the operation should be a noop. The logic to short-circuit execution based on db_table should be added here, making this file the primary source of the bug.'},

While it executes the table and constraint changes, it does so based on instructions from higher-level migration operations.

   'confidence': 10,
   'reason': 'This file manages the in-memory state of models during migrations. Although it tracks model options like db_table, there is no evidence of state corruption or mismanagement.

The issue centers on how callable defaults (e.g., default=list) are propagated and preserved across submissions, especially after validation errors.
